# Flower Shop Console

Welcome to the Flower Shop Console! This project was developed as part of a student project and allows users to purchase pre-designed bouquets or create personalized bouquets, and choose who and when to deliver them. In addition, there are admin options to view statistics about the shop, such as the best-selling shops and customers, and the worst-performing exotic flowers for exemple. This project was developed using C# and MySQL.
